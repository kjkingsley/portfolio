# Computational Astrophysics Projects

## Overview
This repo contains all my Astrophysics research, primarily that done for my MPhil in Physics at the University of Cambridge 2024-25, but also the preliminary self-study done to prepare for the course.
Here you'll find:
- Machine Learning techniques (Bayesian sampling of posteriors to fit astrophysical models to data)
- Data Visualisation (Plotting key data for analysis and for presentation in the thesis)
- Data Processing and Cleaning (Importing raw scientific data and converting it into the required formats for modeling and analysis)

## Folder Contents
The MPhil thesis folder contains the code and figures used for my thesis on "Constraining the spatially resolved mass distribution of high-redshift galaxies":
- Figures plotted throughout my research
- Analysis of my target galaxy's morphology, first plotting the raw image data then applying increasingly sophisticated morphology-fitting.
- Analysis of the galaxy's stellar properties through SED fitting

The Self Study folder contains 2 sample notebooks taken from self study prior to my Master's using tutorials from https://prappleizer.github.io/ to prepare for the course:
- Importing Astrophysical data
- Data handling/processing
- Data visualisation
